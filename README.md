## GitHub Codespaces

We configured the repository to work with GitHub Codespaces. Click the green `<> Code` button, then click on the `Codespaces` tab, then click the green `Create codespace on main` button. It will take a few minutes, but GitHub will create a new Codespace with all the necessary tools and dependencies installed. GitHub offers a generous amount of Codespace time for free each month for personal accounts. 

Payment is required once the monthly allocation of free time is used. Learn more about GitHub's terms and pricing [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#about-github-codespaces-pricing). You are responsible for all expenses incurred through the use of Codespaces.
